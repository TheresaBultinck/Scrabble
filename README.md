Description

Implement a Scrabble anagram generator. In Scrabble a number of characters are combined to form a word. Each character has a value. The value of the word is determined by the sum of its characters. A word is only valid if it's present in a dictionary.The purpose of the anagram generator is to generate a word given a set of characters with the highest value.

Construct permutations of characters (e.g. given ABC, the permutations are ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA)
Find if a word is valid. You may use https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
Find the word with the highest value.
The classes of the Java Collections Framework may be used: https://www.javatpoint.com/collections-in-java

Hint

Constructing the permutations of a set is O(n!). In order to keep the algorithm manageable it's important to prune partial permutations (e.g. no words start with QK so the partial permutation 

Extra

Allow the algorithm to append characters to an existing word. The characters in the existing word are fixed and may not be permutated
Include up to two wildcards characters
